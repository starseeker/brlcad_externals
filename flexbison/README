The Flex lexer (https://github.com/westes/flex) and GNU Bison parser generator
tools (https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) aren't targeted for WIN32
deployment by their original upstreams.  Consequently, we also include the
winflexbison project from https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison to provide
these tools on that platform as well.

We patch the build files of both flex and bison(a vanilla build on Ubuntu
failed with both, during initial testing.)  However, this means we also need to
regenerate the build files and require at least a minimal autotools chain for
successful building on platforms other than Windows.

NOTE:  These are build-only tools, not intended to be bundled with BRL-CAD.  In
particular, GNU Bison uses the GNU General Public License (GPLv3) and is not a
candidate for distribution with BRL-CAD.
