# Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a reliable way to test for the
# presence of the Itk package on a system Tcl/Tk.  We key off of the presence
# of the TK_BLD and ITCL_BLD targets, but that may produce a false negative if
# those builds are both off but we still need Itk.  As far as I can tell the
# "package require Itk" test (which is what is required to properly test for an
# available Itk package) can ONLY be performed successfully on a system that
# supports creation of a graphics window. Window creation isn't typically
# available on continuous integration runners, which means the test will always
# fail there even when it shouldn't.

# We try to find the itk library, since that's the only test we can do without
# needing the graphical invocation.  Unfortunately, even a find_library search
# looking for libitk isn't completely reliable, since the presence of a shared
# library is not a guarantee it is correctly hooked into the "package require"
# mechanism of the system Tcl/Tk we want to use.  (It is possible to have more
# than one Tcl/Tk on a system - this situation is known to have occurred on the
# Mac when 3rd party package managers are used, for example.)

# Hopefully situations where a user has a complex Itcl/Itk setup are rare
# enough that it won't be a significant issue, since there appears to be
# only so much we can do to sort it out...
